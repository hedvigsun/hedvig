**Bio:** Iâ€™m a microbial ecologist/bioinformatician at NASAâ€™s Ames Research Center in northern California, USA. I get to work in all kinds of different systems ranging from the bottoms of our oceans up to the International Space Station ðŸ‘½. Having [gone through it myself](https://astrobiomike.github.io/about/){:target="_blank"}, I very much enjoy trying to help folks get through the initial steep learning curve that lots of us face when we start getting into bioinformatics. In addition to regularly helping to organize and teach at bioinformatics workshops such as [STAMPS](https://mblstamps.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and [ANGUS](https://angus.readthedocs.io/en/2019/){:target="_blank"}, I develop and maintain [Happy Belly Bioinformatics](https://astrobiomike.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, a site that aims to be a useful resource for biologists who are new to bioinformatics ðŸ™‚

**Bio:** The battle between microbes and their viruses is ancient and ongoing. Over billions of years of coevolution, microbes have evolved a great diversity of strategies to protect themselves against viral infections. What drives selection favoring a particular antiviral defense strategy? What new defense systems are still waiting to be discovered? How do defense systems coevolve with pathogens over time, and how does this coevolution feed back into the dynamics of host-virus interactions? The central theme of my previous and ongoing work is the application of tools from the fields of machine learning and complex systems science, alongside more traditional approaches from population genetics and theoretical ecology, to understand the ecology and evolution of antiviral defense strategies.

**Bio:** I am a PhD student in the Microbiology Doctoral Training Program in Dr. Katherine McMahon's lab at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I use a combination of enrichment culture techniques and integrated genome-resolved metagenomics to investigate bacterial population dynamics of engineered wastewater systems. I am passionate about helping people solve their analytical challenges as it relates to their research. I am a certified Carpentries instructor and a co-chair of the Computational Biology, Ecology, and Evolution [(ComBEE)](https://combee-uw-madison.github.io/studyGroup/) study group on the UW-Madison campus.

**Bio:** I am postdoctoral researcher at The Ohio State University in the Colleges of Public Health & Veterinary Preventative Medicine. My current research uses -omic tools to investigate strain level overlap between humans, animals, and the environment, as well as to reconstruct chemical/xenobiotic microbial pathways in the human and animal gut as it relates to health & disease. My PhD work focused on microbial xenobiotic metabolisms in hydraulically fractured oil and gas systems. I am eager to help people who don't have coding or bioinformatics backgrounds learn their way around the command line for their work, particularly for metagenomics and 16S rRNA sequencing analysis.

**Bio:**  I am a geomicrobiologist combining a background in geoscience with a diverse toolkit of novel molecular methods, sequencing analysis, and bioinformatic tools to delve into the interactions between the biosphere and geosphere. I am currently an Assistant Professor of Environmental Biology at Maryville College in Tennessee, USA. I apply methods at the frontier of integrative earth, life, and data science to answer big questions related to the co-evolution of the biosphere and geosphere through deep time and in modern environments.

**Bio:**  I am a PhD candidate in biogeochemistry at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, Stony Brook University, NY in Dr. Gordon Taylorâ€™s Marine Microbial Ecology laboratory. I specialize in the geobiology, or the interaction of geochemical processes and microbes, of oxygen-free environments. My dissertation work at Fayetteville Green Lake, NY, is focused on how the succession of microbial carbon fixation pathways and sulfur metabolisms along redox gradients influences stable isotope signatures. I am especially interested in how they are compartmentalized into suspended and sinking particulate matter in the water column, and ultimately, what is incorporated into sediment. I hope this will provide insight into which early earth anoxic water column processes are reflected in the geologic record. I combine microbiology techniques including Illumina sequencing, stable isotope probing, radiotracer rate measurements, qPCR, and fluorescence in situ hybridization with geochemical techniques to answer these questions.

**Bio:** I am an Assistant Scientist in the Biology Department at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution interested in bioinformatics and microbes in the ocean. My work focuses on characterizing the the interplay of physiological ecology and diversity in the ocean with a focus on eukaryotic plankton. Much of my research has leveraged meta-omic data to derive insights into the diversity and function of these ecosystems.

**Bio:** I'm microbial ecologist/bioinformatician/geobiologist interested in the way the uncultured microbial majority makes a living, and influences life and the planet around it. I apply a mix of bioinformatics, field science, and labwork to try and improve our understanding of microbial communities. I'm currently a postdoc in the lab of Prof. Victoria Orphan at Caltech, where I work on the microbes living at a hydrothermal vent system in the Gulf of California, and those in Mono Lake. In addition, I try to think of ways to leverage the ever-increasing data provided by environmental sequencing to further increase our knowledge of the microbial world.

**Bio:** My research investigates the functional role of microbial communities in the environment. I am currently based at the University of Waikato, New Zealand as a research fellow with Prof. Craig Cary where we study the response of microbial communities within coastal sediments to ocean acidification.  I am also involved in the characterisation of microbial functional roles within the Dry Valley, Ross Ice Shelf and Ross Sea ecosystems of Antarctica.

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (Marine Chemistry & Geochemistry) working to reveal the ecological roles single-celled microbial eukaryotes play in marine ecosystems. My current work is set at deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where I am characterizing in situ protistan community composition and food web interactions. The majority of my work is reliant on using genetic methods to address which microbial eukaryotes are present and what are they doing in the environment.

**Bio:** I love viruses! Except for Coronaviruses. I don't love those. I'm a jack of all trades working on bacteria and viruses in the ocean and in soil. I live and breathe metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and stable isotope probing, but dabbled in amplicon work in the past. Most of all I like to know everything about interactions between viruses and their hosts, and some day it will be my main field. For now I'm a postdoc in Mary Firestone's lab. Show me your cats and dogs and we will be the best of friends.

**Bio:** I am an Assistant Professor at Molloy College where I teach in the Environmental Sciences. For my PhD, I worked to decipher the biogeochemical roles of microbes in the Cariaco Basin, a permanently anoxic ocean basin in the Caribbean Sea. Since becoming a professor, I have developed a passion for teaching bioinformatics to undergraduate students. I like to mix computational, bench work, and microscopy and to involve students in all aspects of my research!

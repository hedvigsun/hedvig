<i>A GWAS meta-analysis, combined with tracing the parental transmitted and non-transmitted alleles in parent–offspring pairs, enabled us to distinguish the effects of maternal and fetal genomes on gestational duration and their links with birth weight. The identified genes are more likely to be differentially expressed during labor and show signs of antagonistic pleiotropy with fetal genome effects on birth weight.</i>
